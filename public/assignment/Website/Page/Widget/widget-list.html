            <p>SpaceX has successfully landed three separate rockets on Earth. Every time they do so, they place these
                boosts inside Hangar 39A at Cape Canaveral, Florida. It looks like they will need a bigger hangar soon
                if they keep this up, but that's the least of their worries. The ability to reuse rockets will
                dramatically cut the cost needed to get supplies and people to space, especially to the International
                Space Station. The next step is for SpaceX to actually refurbish one of these previously used rockets
                and make sure they can fly again.</p>

                0:33were looking for and it was greeted with overwhelming praise of course awakens is
                0:39one of the most entertaining movies I've seen I love that movie if I had walked

                1:07court complaint was echoed more strongly elsewhere was called the biggest fan
                1:11film ever made some claimed our culture suffers from a nostalgia problem
                1:15other said it was an indicator of the stagnation and repetition of our
                1:18collective imagination and the film was also called a remix which seemed to not
                1:23be a compliment was even dubbed the apotheosis of remix culture its logical
                1:28end point
                1:29the remix method of copying transforming and combining is definitely used in the
                1:36force awakens as well as the other works of JH Abrams is remixing a weak point in
                1:41the force awakens remix method growing stale have we reached the limits of our
                1:47index
                1:56AJ Abrams is well acquainted with the concept a remix thing but he's a
                1:59different kind of remixer than George Lucas Lucas tended to copy scenes and
                2:04shots
                2:04abrams tends to copy major story elements this is something he's done
                2:08from the very beginning of his career and his earliest screenplays loyally
                2:11follow established story templates taking care of business is about a rich

                2:28with intellectual disabilities teaching us life lessons and being adorable this
                2:32is dead and gone fishin the disaster-prone lead characters narrowly
                2:38escaped a string of misfortunes and triumph in the end a comedy tradition
                2:42that dates back to at least bus turkey abrams voice becomes more distinct as he
                2:47starts to transform and combined his sources more
                2:51influence of Steven Spielberg emerges in joyride killer truck movie that resemble
                2:55spielberg's dual cross with a road trip
                2:58the TV series Felicity was his take on the popular self-aware teen drama genre
                3:03nineties and incorporate some unusual elements like a Twilight Zone style
                3:08episode and this shocking twist I am
                3:15his next show alias was a Felicity like college drama crossed with a spy
                3:21thriller abrams first big success was lost which took the stranded on an
                3:26island John wrote survivor and cast away and added the nonlinear timeline
                3:30popularized by Quentin Tarantino and surreal plot twists in the twilight zone
                3:38since graduating to the big screen abrams specialty has been rebooting
                3:42familiar material
                3:44mission impossible 3 was an alias like version of the Tom Cruise vehicle and
                3:48renewed in aging franchise super 8 was directed in the style of Spielberg and
                3:53resembled a monster movie version of the ET and his Star Trek films successfully
                4:03relaunch the franchise while pleasing most if not all of the existing friends
                4:08so with this knack for updating and refreshing familiar material abrams
                4:12brought his remix like approach to Star Wars Episode 7 the force awakens
                4:17incorporates a bit of George Lucas style remix there's a shot inspired by
                4:22apocalypse now the X-wing skimming over the water was taken from the film
                4:25Firefox and a sword fight and gently falling snow recalls killed bill which
                4:30itself copy at least no blood but most of the remixing in the force awakens is
                4:34of story elements and the primary source is episode for a new hope in both films
                4:40at all Jedi must be found
                4:42vital information is tucked away in acute droid on a desert planet the Droid
                4:47is found by a young orphan storm troopers searched for the vital
                4:50information and kill innocent people are heroes narrowly escaping the Millennium
                4:54Falcon the orphan forms our relationship with an elder figure on solo has a
                4:57confrontation with someone he owes money there's a space bar filled with wacky
                5:01creatures were here as I stared at and silence for a moment the villains have a
                5:06planet like weapon that destroys planets this is also the second time JJA Abrams
                5:10has destroyed a planet villain murders the other figure which the orphan
                5:13witnesses the heroes go into the planet like weapon to incapacitate something
                5:17ships line at ranch should a particular spot and destroy it
                5:20this is the third time in the series this has happened there's even a joke
                5:24right away blow it up it's always a way to do that which suggests there's a
                5:28twist coming but then there isn't and there's also copied from the original
                5:31Star Wars that seemed like they really should have been changed the first-order
                5:35like the Empire is modeled on nazis despite there being no significant not
                5:39see threats since 1945 and Jenna are again a semi medical plan despite
                5:44sensationally saving the galaxy only a few decades earlier maybe they left the
                5:49recordkeeping to the Ewoks the film certainly isn't all cop in there's
                5:53plenty of transforming as well especially in the characters the hero as
                5:57a woman another lead as a former stormtrooper a villain is a raging
                6:01failure prone fanboy these changes provide some of the freshest narratives
                6:05so the force awakens clearly is a remix but so is everything else for as long as
                6:10humans have been creating we have been copying transforming and combining the
                6:15issues and the remixing in the film it's that it's heavy on copying and later on
                6:19transforming and combining that this was an intentional choice for some break-ins
                6:25was designed to be familiar because we love the familiar that's why more and
                6:29more of Hollywood's top hits new versions of old stories but familiarity
                6:34isn't the only thing we love
                6:36attracted to the novel unusual in this is a smaller riskier market but its
                6:42influential and it's where many of the most enduring films are born the
                6:47familiar and novel both appealed to us think of them as two halves of a
                6:51spectrum box office hits 10 to land on the left
                6:54critical hits tend to land on the right but some films land right in the middle
                6:58like the original Star Wars
                7:00wars
                7:02planned it previously unrelated pieces into a highly unusual innovative package
                7:08yet it also felt very familiar because it copied something well known
                7:12mythical structure of countless Road tales of the past
                7:17something that strongly appeal to our desires for both the novel and familiar
                7:24this target between the novel and the familiar is something we can all aimed
                7:28for we can make our novel ideas mark sensible and understandable and perhaps
                7:33more impactful by copying familiar elements and we can make our familiar
                7:38ideas more fresh exciting and surprising i extensively remixing from diverse
                7:43sources and if you can create that perfect hybrid of the new and the old
                7:48the results can be
                7:50explosive
                8:14ok one last thing in the book The Art of the force awake and you can get a
                8:20glimpse of the remix method of work most of these tags are references to remixing
                8:24like this illustration includes an image of a water bear a weird little
                8:28microscopic creature this one is very closely modelled on the nazis Nuremberg
                8:32rally this early image of snow quiz based on the lincoln memorial race peter
                8:37is a combination of luke's Peter and a tractor mas que nada was inspired by
                8:41Abrams high school teacher rose Gilbert and with this image the artist thought
                8:45he was copying this scene from The Right Stuff which he believed featured a girl
                8:48dressed as a mermaid but it actually doesn't so we thought he was copying but
                8:52he was actually transforming and one last piece of evidence that suggests the
                8:56team behind the force awakens were intentionally remixing is raised last
